- To do so simply click on the filter by date drop down and select whichever date you would like. You can filter by 'All dates' which will display all dates that are available. Filter by 'today' which will display events occuring today. You may also filter by 'This weekend' which will display all events occuring this weekend. The last filter allows you to filter by month, which will show you all events occuring this month.
